# Sales-Analysis
## Purpose: 
Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.
## Description: 
In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to present my findings effectively. This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
